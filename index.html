            <p style="color: white; text-align: justify;">Dive into the eerie world of "Too Close" a suspenseful comic with Gen Z humor. Join us in discovering how a mysterious party invitation leads four unsuspecting girls into a bone-chilling reality that exceeds their wildest nightmares. 

                Our protagonist, Jessica, and her friends Sara, Ana, and Becky, thought they were in for an evening of costumed fun, playful scares, and sugary punch. But as the night prowls on, the line between masquerade and reality blurs. As each friend mysteriously disappears one by one, Jessica slowly realizes that the party is not what it seems. 
                
                Crafted with a love for classic horror and a flair for the dramatic, "Too Close" is more than just a tale of fright; it's a comedy-filled adventure that warns against accepting mysterious party invitations. Because you might just end up going somewhere you regret. 
                
                Will Jessica survive the night and be able to find her friends? Or will she mysteriously disappear along with them? Uncover the truth and find out—if you're brave enough to peek inside!</p>
